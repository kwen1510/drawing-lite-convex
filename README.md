# Live Drawing Lite

A real-time collaborative drawing application for classrooms, featuring teacher-student interaction with Apple Pencil optimization and professional Chinese character grid templates.

## üéØ Overview

Live Drawing Lite is a web-based drawing platform designed for educational environments. Teachers can monitor multiple student canvases in real-time, annotate directly on student work, and send templates or images for structured practice. Students can draw freely while receiving live feedback from their teacher.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Batched stroke points** reduce network overhead

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Internet connection for Supabase real-time features
- Supabase account (free tier works)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository

2. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
   - Get your project URL and anon key
   - Add to each HTML file (teacher.html, student.html):
   ```javascript
   window.SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
   window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
   ```

3. **Open files**:
   - `index.html` - Landing page with links to teacher/student portals
   - `teacher.html` - Teacher dashboard
   - `student.html` - Student canvas
   - `canvas.html` - Standalone drawing tool (no collaboration)

### Usage

#### For Teachers:
1. Open `teacher.html` in your browser
2. Session code auto-generates (or use URL parameter: `?session=ABC123`)
3. Click "Start session" to go live
4. Share QR code or join URL with students
5. Monitor student work in real-time grid view
6. Click any card to annotate
7. Use "Prepare next question" to send templates/images

#### For Students:
1. Open `student.html` (or scan teacher's QR code)
2. Enter your name (auto-saved for next time)
3. Enter session code (auto-populated if using QR link)
4. Click "Join Session"
5. Start drawing! Your work appears on teacher's screen instantly

## üé® Template System

### Built-in Templates
- **Hanzi Grid**: Single-box grid for Chinese character practice with guide lines
- **Graph Paper (Corner)**: Grid aligned to canvas corners
- **Graph Paper (Cross)**: Grid with center cross for symmetry practice

### Custom Images
- Upload PNG, JPG, or other image formats
- Images fit to canvas with letterbox scaling
- Maintains aspect ratio for consistency
- Works offline with base64 encoding

### Template Workflow
1. Teacher selects mode and template/image (loads locally)
2. Preview appears in small window
3. Teacher clicks "Send next question"
4. All canvases clear (student + teacher strokes)
5. Template broadcasts to all students
6. Late joiners automatically receive current template

## üì± Device Support

### Optimized For:
- **iPad with Apple Pencil** - Best experience
- **Wacom/Drawing tablets** - Full pressure support
- **Touch screens** - Works but pen mode recommended
- **Desktop with mouse** - Full features available

### Browser Compatibility:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ Safari (iPad/Mac)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Internet Explorer (Not supported)

Confirmed working (Oct 2025):
- Teacher annotation uses the same stable pointer model as student
- Student strokes use Bezier smoothing (matches teacher)
- Undo/redo/clear are ownership‚Äëaware and reliable
- Refresh protection on teacher with confirmation; students kicked only after confirm

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No build process required
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling via CDN
- **Canvas API** - Native 2D drawing with DPR support
- **Pointer Events** - Unified input handling (pen/mouse/touch)

### Backend/Sync
- **Supabase Realtime** - WebSocket-based broadcasting
- **Channel-based rooms** - Isolated sessions per code
- **Event-driven architecture** - Broadcast events for all actions
- **No server-side code** - Fully client-side application

### Data Flow
1. **Student draws** ‚Üí Stroke points collected
2. **Points batched** ‚Üí Throttled transmission (50ms)
3. **Broadcast to channel** ‚Üí Supabase relays to all subscribers
4. **Teacher receives** ‚Üí Renders on card + modal (if open)
5. **Teacher annotates** ‚Üí Same flow in reverse with `isTeacher: true` flag

### Storage
- **localStorage** - User preferences (teacher/student settings)
- **sessionStorage** - Temporary drawing state (student)
- **No database** - Everything is ephemeral and real-time

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Refresh protection requires interaction**: Modern browsers need user gesture before `beforeunload` works. An invisible overlay captures first click to enable protection.

2. **No chat feature**: Communication is visual-only (drawing/annotation). Add voice/text separately if needed.

3. **No recording/playback**: Strokes are not persisted after session ends. Consider recording canvas to video if needed.

4. **Limited to Supabase channels**: Session capacity depends on Supabase limits (~200 concurrent connections per channel on free tier).

5. **No student-to-student visibility**: Students only see their own canvas + teacher annotations. Consider adding gallery view if needed.

## üìä Performance Notes

- **Recommended**: Max 30 students per session for optimal performance
- **Stroke throttling**: Points sent in batches every 50ms to reduce network load
- **Canvas optimization**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps rendering
- **Memory management**: Old strokes persist in memory until cleared

## üéì Use Cases

### Education
- **Chinese character practice** with structured grids
- **Math graphing** exercises on coordinate planes
- **Art classes** with live feedback
- **Remote tutoring** one-on-one or small groups

### Professional
- **Whiteboard sessions** for remote teams
- **Design reviews** with markup capability
- **Brainstorming** with visual collaboration

## üîê Privacy & Data

- **No data storage**: All drawing data is ephemeral (lives only during session)
- **No user accounts**: Anonymous usernames, no authentication required
- **No analytics**: No tracking or telemetry beyond Supabase connection logs
- **Local preferences**: Settings saved locally in browser only

## üìù Console Logging

Debug logs are included for troubleshooting:
- `[LOAD]` - Preference loading from localStorage
- `[SAVE]` - Preference saving to localStorage
- `[INIT]` - Initial state on page load
- `[UI]` - UI interactions and updates
- `[SESSION]` - Session lifecycle events

Open browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) to view logs.
